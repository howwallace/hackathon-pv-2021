This syntax makes `min_distance` an **optional argument**; if it's not specified (i.e., if your call `are_they_properly_distanced(person1, person2)`), it takes on a default value of `2`.  However, after [a study](https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab230) found that a distance of 1 meter was as effective at limiting viral spread (specifically, in primary/secondary schools, given masking, etc.), you might want to use `min_distance=1`.  To do this, you just need to call `are_they_properly_distanced(person1, person2, min_distance=1)`.  Try it below and see how it changes your function's answer for who's properly distanced:"
