# Bienvenue / Welcome

Welcome, and thank so much for participating in the Paul-Valéry Hackathon, 23 June 2021!!

## Instructions

The challenge consists of five problems, all with a common theme: COVID-19.  For each problem, you will find a Jupyter notebook file (the last one is actually just a plain python script) in this directory.  Each file describes the problem in multiple parts and asks you to implement solutions right in the file.

PLEASE FIND ME IF YOU NEED CLARIFICATION, HELP, OR JUST WANT TO TALK THROUGH YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS!

We'll be using Visual Studio Code.  To run a "chunk" of a Jupyter notebook, just press the green arrow on the upper left of the chunk; to run an entire python script (as you'll do in PROBLEM 5), just press the green arrow on the upper right of the window.

## Disclaimer

Please note that I shouldn't be taken to agree with any particular policy (especially w.r.t confinement), just because a problem is inspired by it.  Though some of these problems do indeed demonstrate that (at least in theory) certain restrictions lessen expected infections and deaths, this is only one metric for the *overall effect* of the policy.  There are other metrics (like long-term educational and economic outcomes) that are important in measuring the effect of a policy, but these are harder to model.

I've included some links to papers, data sources, and web articles that are relevant to the problems; I don't make any money if you click those links.

## Contributions

I conceived and wrote these practice problems in the wee hours of the night instead of doing work that I'm more strictly obligated to do.  If you'd like to use or adapt these problems, feel free---it'd be cool if you'd credit me somewhere.  If I've made a mistake somewhere, please let me know!  You can contact me at harperowwallace \[at] gmail.

The data I've included in the "data" directory is linked in the corresponding problems.  It's publicly available.

Special thanks to Thibaut Plisson and Stéphane Pamphile for their help in organizing, publicizing, and supervising this event.  Many thanks also to the US--France Fulbright Commission and the Rosalind Swenson Fulbright Enrichment Fund for funding this project.
